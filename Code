#Set Airflow Home (optional):
#Airflow requires a home directory, and uses ~/airflow by default, but you can set a different location if you prefer. The AIRFLOW_HOME environment variable is used to inform Airflow of the desired location. This step of setting the environment variable should be done before installing Airflow so that the installation process knows where to store the necessary files.
export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow
